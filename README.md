# duckdb-vector-index (`vindex`)

A DuckDB extension for **vector similarity search at scale**. Superset of the
official [`vss`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-vss) extension: supports
HNSW, IVF (IVF-Flat / IVF-RaBitQ / IVF-PQ / IVF-ScaNN), DiskANN (Vamana
graph with codes held out-of-band so the graph can evict past RAM),
AiSAQ (Vamana graph whose PQ codes are paged from DuckDB's BufferPool on
demand, enabling indexes larger than RAM), and
SPANN (IVF with closure-replica writes so boundary points survive a
single-cell probe), with pluggable quantization — RaBitQ (bits ∈
{1,2,3,4,5,7,8}, default **3-bit**), PQ, and ScaNN anisotropic PQ — plus
an optimizer-level rerank pass against the authoritative `FLOAT[d]` column.

A live docs site at **<https://icemap.github.io/duckdb-vector-index/>** lets
you click through every algorithm × quantizer × metric combination and see
the exact `CREATE INDEX` SQL it would generate, with hover cards covering
the capability trade-offs of each choice:

## Installing

`vindex` is published to the DuckDB
[community-extensions](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/vindex.html)
repository, so the signed per-platform build loads with two lines:

```sql
INSTALL vindex FROM community;
LOAD vindex;
```

No `-unsigned` flag or `allow_unsigned_extensions` is required — the
community-extensions pipeline signs each `vindex.duckdb_extension` binary
after build. DuckDB versions must match the one vindex was built against
(currently **v1.5.3**).

### From source

If you want to hack on vindex or run against a newer DuckDB than the
community repo has rebuilt for yet:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Icemap/duckdb-vector-index.git
cd duckdb-vector-index
./scripts/bootstrap.sh   # pulls the duckdb + extension-ci-tools submodules
make                     # release build → build/release/extension/vindex/vindex.duckdb_extension
```

Then load the unsigned build:

```sql
-- duckdb -unsigned
LOAD 'build/release/extension/vindex/vindex.duckdb_extension';
```

Or, inside a session started without `-unsigned`:

```sql
SET allow_unsigned_extensions = true;
LOAD 'build/release/extension/vindex/vindex.duckdb_extension';
```

### From a GitHub release

Unsigned per-arch binaries (`vindex.linux_amd64.duckdb_extension`,
`vindex.osx_arm64.duckdb_extension`, …) are also attached to each
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/Icemap/duckdb-vector-index/releases)
and can be `LOAD '<path>'`-ed the same way. Prefer
`INSTALL vindex FROM community;` unless you need a release that has not
propagated to community-extensions yet.

## Quickstart

```sql
INSTALL vindex FROM community;
LOAD vindex;

CREATE TABLE docs (id INT, embedding FLOAT[768]);
-- ... populate from your model of choice ...

-- HNSW with RaBitQ 3-bit compression (default), >99% Recall@10
CREATE INDEX docs_idx ON docs USING HNSW (embedding)
    WITH (metric='cosine', quantizer='rabitq', bits=3);

-- Or IVF-RaBitQ — cheaper build, tunable recall/speed via nlist/nprobe.
-- Recall@10 ≥ 0.97 on SIFT1M at nlist=1024/nprobe=32.
CREATE INDEX docs_idx ON docs USING IVF (embedding)
    WITH (metric='cosine', quantizer='rabitq', bits=3, rerank=10,
          nlist=1024, nprobe=32);

-- DiskANN (Vamana) with PQ compression — graph blocks evict from the
-- buffer pool so the index can exceed RAM. PQ defaults (m=dim/4, bits=8)
-- are fine for most 768-d models; tune `diskann_r`/`diskann_l` if you need
-- a wider beam.
CREATE INDEX docs_idx ON docs USING DISKANN (embedding)
    WITH (metric='cosine', quantizer='pq', bits=8, rerank=10,
          diskann_r=64, diskann_l=100);

-- SPANN — IVF with closure replicas. Boundary points are written into
-- every centroid within `closure_factor × d_best`, so a single-cell
-- probe still finds them. Paper defaults: replica_count=8, closure_factor=1.1.
CREATE INDEX docs_idx ON docs USING SPANN (embedding)
    WITH (metric='cosine', quantizer='rabitq', bits=3, rerank=10,
          nlist=1024, nprobe=32, replica_count=8, closure_factor=1.1);

-- AiSAQ — paged-PQ Vamana graph. PQ codes live in DuckDB blocks and are
-- paged on demand, so the index scales past RAM. Accepts PQ or ScaNN only.
-- Recall@10 ≥ 0.95 on SIFT1M.
CREATE INDEX docs_idx ON docs USING AISAQ (embedding)
    WITH (metric='l2sq', quantizer='pq', m=16, bits=8, rerank=10,
          aisaq_r=64, aisaq_l=100);

-- Query uses the standard DuckDB distance function; the index kicks in.
SELECT id, embedding
FROM docs
ORDER BY array_cosine_distance(embedding, [ ... ]::FLOAT[768])
LIMIT 10;
```

## Why not usearch?

The upstream `duckdb-vss` extension (which this repo forks) wraps
[`unum-cloud/usearch`](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch). We replaced it
with an in-house HNSW implementation (`src/algo/hnsw/` + `src/include/vindex/hnsw_core.hpp`).
We ran a side-by-side microbench (`test/bench/bench_hnsw_core.cpp`) at matched
hyperparameters before making the call:

| engine | build (s) | QPS | Recall@10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| usearch | 21.0 | 9,664 | 0.49 |
| HnswCore (ours) | 24.5 | 10,444 | 0.52 |

`N=100,000  D=128  NQ=200  K=10  M=16  M0=32  ef_construction=128  ef_search=64`

Throughput and recall are comparable (QPS ratio 1.08). What we gain from
owning the code path is the thing usearch cannot give us:

1. **Pluggable quantization.** usearch's scalar types are fixed at (`f32`,
   `f16`, `i8`, `b1`) — these are pure type casts, not compression. usearch
   deliberately **does not own the vector data**: `add(key, ptr)` only
   registers a `key → ptr` mapping and the caller keeps the `FLOAT[d]`
   around. That design can't host RaBitQ (rotated + bit-packed codes), PQ
   codebooks, or ScaNN's anisotropic quantization, because the "code"
   doesn't exist outside the index — we produce it. We own it, so we can
   compress it.
2. **Rerank / fine-search.** RaBitQ is a coarse filter — the planner needs
   access to the top-`k × rerank_multiple` candidates to re-score them against
   the authoritative `FLOAT[d]` column. usearch hides the candidate list
   behind its iterator, with no extension point.
3. **Block-native storage.** DiskANN and SPANN need per-node block
   addressing so the page cache can evict cold regions. `IndexBlockStore`
   is the shared substrate; the usearch blob would have to be torn apart
   anyway.

### Memory footprint

The bench above deliberately omitted a memory column because a naive RSS
comparison is misleading. usearch's 14.7 MB resident delta is real but
narrow — it measures the bench's mode, which is not the mode a DuckDB index
actually runs in.

- **In the microbench**, vectors live in a caller-owned `std::vector<float>`
  and usearch's `add(key, ptr)` just registers a pointer into it — no copy,
  hence the small RSS. That pointer mode requires the caller to keep the
  backing array alive for the lifetime of the index.
- **Inside DuckDB**, column-store `FLOAT[d]` blocks are paged in and out of
  the buffer pool; there is no stable `float*` an index can hang onto across
  scans. So `duckdb-vss` has usearch **copy the float32 codes internally** —
  the external-pointer trick is unavailable. usearch's index RSS in a real
  DuckDB process is roughly the same as our `flat` path (one float32 per
  vector, whatever graph overhead on top).

Index RSS for N=100k, d=128, same hyperparameters as the bench:

| index                     | per-vector code | index RSS |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| usearch, bench mode       | 512 B (external)| 14.7 MB (caller holds the 51 MB) |
| HnswCore + `flat`         | 512 B (inline)  | 75.8 MB   |
| HnswCore + `rabitq` 3-bit | 60 B (inline)   | ~34.0 MB  |

What actually matters is the `rabitq` row. Owning the code path lets us
compress the per-vector payload ~8.5× and pull total index RSS below what
either `flat` path can reach. usearch's `f32 / f16 / i8 / b1` options are
type casts, not compression — none of them can host rotated + bit-packed
RaBitQ codes.

## Quantizer defaults

For the capability matrix (metrics accepted, trade-offs per
algorithm / quantizer combination) see the
[interactive docs](https://icemap.github.io/duckdb-vector-index/). This
table just pins the `WITH (…)` defaults so you know what you're overriding:

| `quantizer` | Default `bits` | Other overridable options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flat`   | — | — |
| `rabitq` | 3 | `bits` ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} |
| `pq`     | 8 | `bits` ∈ {4, 8}; `m` defaults to `dim/4` |
| `scann`  | 8 | `bits` ∈ {4, 8}; `m` defaults to `dim/4`; `eta` (default 4) |

> **AiSAQ** accepts only `pq` and `scann` — it requires a LUT-capable
> compressing quantizer. `flat` (stores full fp32, defeats the paged layout)
> and `rabitq` (no LUT distance path) are rejected at `CREATE INDEX` time.

### Quantizer bits vs recall

Low-bit RaBitQ is a **coarse filter** — on its own the estimated distances are
noisy, so the expected usage is:

> top `k × rerank_multiple` candidates ranked by estimated distance → re-rank
> those candidates using the exact distance from the original `FLOAT[d]` column.

The numbers below are Recall@10 over a 1,000-vector × 128-dim Gaussian fixture
(scalar path; see `test/unit/test_rabitq_quantizer.cpp`). End-to-end numbers
through DuckDB on the INRIA [siftsmall](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/) set
(10k × 128-d, 100 queries, `make bench`) match the shape:

| config | Recall@10 | build | 100 queries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hnsw-flat` | 0.996 | 0.5 s | 0.08 s |
| `hnsw-rabitq3 + rerank=10` | 1.000 | 1.9 s | 0.09 s |
| `hnsw-rabitq1 + rerank=50` | 0.998 | 3.0 s | 0.18 s |

| `bits` | No rerank | + 10× rerank | + 20× rerank | Bytes / vector (d=128) | vs float32 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ~0.40 | ~0.85 | ≥0.90 | 16 + 12 trailer = **28 B** | 18× smaller |
| 2 | ~0.60 | ~0.95 | ≥0.97 | 32 + 12 = **44 B** | 12× smaller |
| 3 *(default)* | ~0.80 | ≥0.98 | **≥0.99** | 48 + 12 = **60 B** | 8.5× smaller |
| 4 | ~0.90 | ≥0.99 | ≥0.99 | 64 + 12 = **76 B** | 6.7× smaller |
| 5 | ~0.95 | ≥0.99 | ≥0.99 | 80 + 12 = **92 B** | 5.6× smaller |
| 7 | ~0.98 | ≥0.99 | ≥0.99 | 112 + 12 = **124 B** | 4.1× smaller |
| 8 | ~0.99 | ≥0.99 | ≥0.99 | 128 + 12 = **140 B** | 3.7× smaller |
| float32 (flat) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | **512 B** | 1× |

**Rules of thumb:**

- `bits=3` is the default for a reason — it's the sweet spot on recall × memory.
- `bits=1` and `bits=2` **only make sense with rerank ≥ 20×**. Using them
  without rerank will emit a runtime warning and give you 40–60% Recall@10.
- `bits ≥ 5` tends not to pay off vs `bits=3 + bigger rerank`; memory-bound
  workloads almost always prefer lower bits + more rerank.

### The rerank pass

`WITH (rerank = N)` on `CREATE INDEX` (or the session pragma
`SET vindex_rerank_multiple = N`) tells the planner to pull `k × N` candidates
from the index and re-rank them by **exact** `array_distance` against the
authoritative `FLOAT[d]` column. The plan shape is uniform regardless of `N`:

```
TOP_N (k) ← PROJECTION ← VINDEX_INDEX_SCAN (emits k × N row_ids)
```

This is enforced by `test/sql/hnsw/hnsw_rerank.test`. There is no
"skip rerank" shortcut — the upstream operator is always the exact-distance
step, which is why `bits=1 + rerank=20` can recover >99% Recall@10.

## AiSAQ — paged-PQ vector search

AiSAQ ("All-in-Storage ANNS") is a single-layer Vamana graph whose PQ codes
are stored in DuckDB blocks and paged through the BufferPool on demand. Unlike
DiskANN (which holds PQ codes in contiguous RAM), AiSAQ's codes are
evictable — the index can grow larger than RAM, with cold PQ pages evicted by
DuckDB's global `memory_limit` and re-paged on access.

### When to choose AiSAQ vs DiskANN

| | DiskANN | AiSAQ |
|---|---|---|
| PQ codes during build | RAM-resident (fast) | RAM-resident (flat buffer, same speed) |
| PQ codes at search | RAM-resident | Paged from BufferPool (evictable) |
| Memory beyond RAM | Graph only; codes must fit | Graph + codes evictable |
| Search latency | Lower (pointer arithmetic) | Higher (BufferPool pin per code) |
| Best for | Datasets that fit in RAM | Datasets that exceed RAM |

### Build acceleration

AiSAQ supports a three-tier build acceleration system controlled by
`WITH (build_strategy=...)` or the session option
`SET vindex_aisaq_build_strategy=...`:

| Strategy | Description | Memory cost | Build speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Picks the best tier that fits in RAM budget | — | — |
| `pq_buffer` | Flat PQ code + graph node buffers in RAM during build | `N × (code_size + node_size)` | Fast (zero I/O) |
| `paged` | Per-prune gather; PQ codes read from BufferPool | ~1.6 KB per prune call | Slower (BufferPool pins) |
| `exact_prune` | Same as `pq_buffer` but uses full-precision vectors for prune distances | `N × (code_size + node_size + dim×4)` | **8× slower** than `pq_buffer`; best recall |

The `auto` strategy picks `pq_buffer` when `N × (code_size + node_size)` fits
in 25% of `memory_limit` (overridable via `WITH (ram_budget_mb=...)`), falling
back to `paged` otherwise. `exact_prune` is always opt-in — it mirrors the
reference `aisaq-diskann` implementation's use of full-precision prune
distances, giving marginally better graph quality at 8× the build cost.

```sql
-- Explicit strategy override:
CREATE INDEX idx ON t USING AISAQ(vec)
    WITH (quantizer='pq', m=16, bits=8, aisaq_r=64, aisaq_l=100, build_strategy='exact_prune');

-- Session-level override:
SET vindex_aisaq_build_strategy = 'paged';

-- Explicit RAM budget (MB) for build-time flat buffers:
CREATE INDEX idx ON t USING AISAQ(vec)
    WITH (quantizer='pq', m=16, bits=8, ram_budget_mb=2048);
```

### Key parameters

| Option | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aisaq_r` | 64 | 4–256 | Graph out-degree (R) |
| `aisaq_l` | 100 | 4–1024 | Search beam width (L) |
| `aisaq_l_build` | = `aisaq_r` | 4–1024 | Build beam width (decoupled from search; Vamana paper recommends L_build ≈ R) |
| `aisaq_alpha` | 1.2 | 1.0–2.0 | RobustPrune relaxation factor |
| `aisaq_inline_pq` | 0 | 0–`aisaq_r` | Inline PQ codes for first N neighbors (faster search, larger nodes) |
| `aisaq_entry_points` | 16 | 1–64 | Number of cached entry points for search |
| `aisaq_beam_width` | 8 | — | I/O batching hint for search |
| `aisaq_io_limit` | 0 | — | Max PQ code page-ins per search (0 = unlimited) |

### Label-column filtering

AiSAQ supports label-filtered search via `WITH (label_column='cat')`, where
`cat` must be a `BIGINT` column. When a `WHERE` predicate on `cat` is present,
the optimizer routes it into the index scan:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx ON docs USING AISAQ(embedding)
    WITH (quantizer='pq', m=16, bits=8, label_column='category');

-- EQUALS: uses the label's medoid as the single entry point
SELECT id FROM docs WHERE category = 5
    ORDER BY array_distance(embedding, [...]::FLOAT[768]) LIMIT 10;

-- RANGE: adaptive — all matching medoids (≤ n_entry_points) or global fallback
SELECT id FROM docs WHERE category BETWEEN 3 AND 7
    ORDER BY array_distance(embedding, [...]::FLOAT[768]) LIMIT 10;
```

Supported operators: `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `BETWEEN`, and folded
conjuncts (`cat > 1 AND cat < 5`). Non-literal predicates (subqueries, etc.)
fall through to post-hoc filtering.

### Logging

Build progress and per-phase timing are available via the `vindex_log_level`
session option or the `VINDEX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (env var
overrides session option):

```sql
SET vindex_log_level = 'info';    -- phase milestones, throttled 2s
SET vindex_log_level = 'debug';   -- per-page granularity
SET vindex_log_level = 'profile'; -- per-insert timing breakdowns
```

```sh
VINDEX_LOG_LEVEL=info python3 test/bench/run_recall.py --algo aisaq-pq
```

Output goes to stderr (sqllogictest-safe). Default is `off`. See AGENTS.md
"Profiling" section for samply profiling instructions.

## Building

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh   # clones duckdb + extension-ci-tools
make                     # release build → build/release/extension/vindex/
make test                # SQL logic tests (test/sql/)
make unit                # Catch2 unit tests (test/unit/)
make bench               # recall regression on siftsmall (~5 s, auto-downloads)
python3 test/bench/run_recall.py --algo aisaq-pq --dataset sift1m  # AiSAQ on SIFT1M
```

`make bench` downloads the [siftsmall](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/)
dataset into `test/bench/datasets/` on first run and fails non-zero if any
Recall@10 threshold regresses. Full-size SIFT1M is wired but gated — pass
`--dataset sift1m` to `run_recall.py` to exercise it.
